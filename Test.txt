Hello, invisible friend, my imagry, YOU. Nothing is clear…engulfed with circling my mind with madness…I find myself lost, awake but not conscious, my brain exudes neuron flashes, vibrating, trying to ignite me, stir me to something I could be…this isn’t my life…I’ve lost myself, I’ve lost my direction, I’ve gone–
